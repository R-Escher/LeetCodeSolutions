/*
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
    Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:
    Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
    Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
    The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:
    n == ratings.length
    1 <= n <= 2 * 104
    0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

// This solution has Time Complexity O(nÂ²), but Space Complexity O(n).
// For a Time Complexity O(n) solution one should create an extra vector and store in it the minimum values looking back.
// And then run the vector in reverse looking forward and comparing to the extra vector with max().
